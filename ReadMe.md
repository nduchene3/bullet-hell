# Basic Game Example Using SFML

This is a basic "bullet hell" style game implemented in C++ using the SFML libraries.

## Installation

1. The SFML library files were not included in this repo, you can download them from http://www.sfml-dev.org, this example was built using SFML2.2
2. Make sure to configure the project to reference the SFML library (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.2/start-vc.php), You can copy the entire SFML2.2 directory to the project directory and you can skip this step.
3. This project is linked using the dynamic version of SFML so you will need to copy the *.dll files from SFML-2.2/bin directry to your Debug/Release directory before you can run the project.

## Controls

*Spacebar - Shoot player projectile
*Arrow keys - Move player
*Return - Restarts game
